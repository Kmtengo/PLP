Place your ksb-logo.jpg file in this directory.

The Logo component (src/components/Logo.tsx) currently uses a placeholder.
Once you add the ksb-logo.jpg file here, you can update the Logo component to use:

<img src="/src/assets/ksb-logo.jpg" alt="Kenya Sugar Board" className={sizes[size]} />

Instead of the current placeholder div.
